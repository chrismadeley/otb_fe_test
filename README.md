# On the Beach Frontend Software Engineer code test

## Built by Chris Madeley (madeley@mail.com) 5/6/2022

With more time I would have built this using Vue.js making use of reusable components & external data sources.
Build would have been completed using webpack to minify the CSS & use code linting etc.

For time reasons, I've used jQuery, my vanilla JS is a little rusty (I've been mostly a back-end developer / tech lead for the last 8 years)

### Additions I would like to have added to current code:
* Ability to sort by either ascending or descending order, currently only ascending is available.
* More tweaks for responsive layout.
* Added fallbacks for older browsers
* Added accessibility features
